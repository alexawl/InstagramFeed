              <div class="footer">One of the most important things you can do when you bring a Pug into your life is the socialization process. Actually the process should never end.
                You want to expose your Pug to new situations carefully and in a controlled way.</div>

                <footer>I cannot imagine life without Charlie and I just hope the inevitable is not for MANY years! And now I cannot imagine life without a dog. That unbridled happiness and unconditional love? I never want to be without that again. I firmly believe having a dog makes me a happier, healthier, kinder, and in general nicer person. </footer>

                <footer>Peter and I laugh more because of Charlie. Around the same time we got Charlie, I started buying and not killing plants. And I became vegan. So, now I am a vegan, dog loving person who is able to keep plants alive. Who knows what else could happen?  Anything is possible. </footer>

                    <footer>We have a seasonal 'glamping' Airbnb and one of the big perks is people can bring their dogs. We've met some wonderful people and Charlie gets to hang out with some really great dogs. While I'm pretty sure Charlie loves me BEST, he actually 'loves up' anyone who wants/needs it. It's not uncommon for a guest to say how snuggling and walking with Charlie was one of the best parts of their time at our Pondhouse. Guests routinely talk Charlie up in our reviews.</footer>

She is 9 years old and my best friend. I got her out of college and she's been with me through thick and thin. I've learned a lot about life with her by my side. She's the smartest dog I know. Kira is also tattle taleâ€¦</footer>

                          <footer>Life as a 'dog person' was a whole new way of being in the world. I stopped to pet dogs and talk with the owners. I also spent a lot of time on Petfinder and making visits to shelters looking for 'our' dog. </footer>
